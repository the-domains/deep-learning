description: 'Note: This is the final part of a detailed three-part series on machine translation with neural networks by Kyunghyun Cho. You may enjoy part 1 and part 2. In the previous post in this series, I introduced a simple encoder-decoder model for machine translation. This simple encoder-decoder model is excellent at English-French translation.'
