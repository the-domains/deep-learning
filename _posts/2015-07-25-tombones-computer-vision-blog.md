    description: 'Matching an infrared image of a face to its visible light counterpart is a difficult task, but one that deep neural networks are now coming to grips with. One problem with infrared surveillance videos or infrared CCTV images is that it is hard to recognize the people in them.'

description: 'We all know that deep convolutional neural networks have produced some stellar results on object detection and recognition benchmarks in the past two years (2012-2014), so you might wonder: what did the earlier object recognition techniques look like? How do the designs of earlier recognition systems relate to the modern multi-layer convolution-based framework?'
