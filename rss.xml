            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Bayesian Reasoning and Deep Learning</h1><p>I gave a talk entitled 'Bayesian Reasoning and Deep Learning' recently. Here is the abstract and the slides for interest. Deep learning and Bayesian machine learning are currently two of the most active areas of machine learning research.</p><img src="http://blog.shakirm.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/bayesDeep.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Convolutional autoencoders in python/theano/lasagne</h1><p>If you are just looking for code for a convolutional autoencoder in python, look at this git. It needs quite a few python dependencies, the only non-standard ones are theano, nolearn, and lasagne (make sure they are up to date). Also there is a section at the end of this post that explains it.</p><img src="https://swarbrickjones.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/blobs1.png?w=352&h=914"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Visualizing GoogLeNet Classes</h1><p>Ever wondered what a deep neural network thinks a Dalmatian should look like? Well, wonder no more. Recently Google published a post describing how they managed to use deep neural networks to generate class visualizations and modify images through the so called "inceptionism" method.</p><img src="http://auduno.github.io/deepdraw/images/deepdraw_example_0013.png"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Brain vs Deep Learning Part I: Computational Complexity - Or Why the Singularity Is Nowhere Near</h1><p>In this blog post I will delve into the brain and explain its basic information processing machinery and compare it to deep learning. I do this by moving step-by-step along with the brains electrochemical and biological information processing pipeline and relating it directly to the architecture of convolutional nets.</p><img src="https://timdettmers.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/neuron_anatomy1.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>How does features extraction on images work? - Quora</h1><p>There is no single answer for this question since there are many diverse set of methods to extract feature from an image. First, what is called feature? "a distinctive attribute or aspect of something." so the thing is to have some set of values for a particular instance that diverse that instance from the counterparts.</p><img src="http://qph.is.quoracdn.net/main-qimg-c8e4e71c422c34a3cb18ee9323085c10?convert_to_webp=true"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>A Full Hardware Guide to Deep Learning</h1><p>Deep Learning is very computationally intensive, so you will need a fast CPU with many cores, right? Or is it maybe wasteful to buy a fast CPU? One of the worst things you can do when building a deep learning system is to waste money on hardware that is unnecessary.</p><img src="https://timdettmers.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/suspectlineup.jpg&h=394"></article>]]></description>
